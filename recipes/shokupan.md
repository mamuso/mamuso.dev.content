## Ingredients

The ingredients are for a 2kin pan (the one we have ðŸ˜…)

- 334Â gÂ warm water
- 28Â gÂ sugar
- 14Â gÂ honey
- 9Â g salt
- 9.4Â g instant yeast
- 470Â gÂ bread flour
- 28Â gÂ skim milk powder or nonfat dry milk powder
- 34Â gÂ unsalted butter

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, salt, and honey. Mix well together. Then, add the yeast. Whisk it all together and set aside in a warm place for 10 minutes. You want to see bubbly foam on the surface.
2. Meanwhile, combine the bread flour and skim or nonfat dry milk powder in a stand mixer bowl. Mix it together and make a well in the middle of the flour mixture.
3. Once you confirm the foamy surface on the yeast mixture, pour it into the well of the flour mixture, scraping every bit of the liquid with a silicone spatula or dough scraper. Then, mix it until combined. Keep this yeast mixture bowl, as youâ€™ll be putting the dough ball in it later.
4. Set up the stand mixer with a dough hook attachment. Knead the dough on Speed 2 for 3 minutes. This is just to get started. The ingredients should be well combined after this step.
5. Next, increase the speed and knead the dough on Speed 4 for 6 minutes. The dough will be smoother than before, yet it should still look a bit rough and bumpy.
6. Add the butter cubes to the dough. Knead the dough again on Speed 2 for 3 minutes, or until you can no longer see any streaks of butter.
7. Then, knead the dough on Speed 4 for 6 minutes. While spinning, the dough will stretch and elongate.
8. Stop the mixer and check the texture of the dough. It should be smoother, shinier, softer, and thinner when itâ€™s stretched. At this stage, the dough is still attached to the bottom of the mixer bowl.
9. Now, knead the dough on Speed 6 for 4Â½ minutes. From here, you MUST hold down your stand mixer with your handw since the machine will shake and move, and it could possibly fall off the countertop.The dough should look really shiny, silky, soft, and smooth (not sticky), and pass the windowpane test.
10. Once your dough passed the windowpane test, lightly dust the work surface and your hands with flour to prevent sticking. Slam and fold the dough 5 times.
11. Pick it up and pull the edges of the dough from all sides to create a smooth, taut skin. Tuck and pinch the edges underneath to hide them at the bottom. Put the dough ball in a lightly oiled bowl and cover it with plastic.
12. Let the dough rise for 40 minutes. The dough will become 3 times bigger in size. Once the dough has tripled in size, dust some flour on top and use your index finger to poke the middle of the dough. If the hole does not close up, itâ€™s ready. If the dough closes up immediately, proof the dough a little longer and test again.
13. Uncover and invert the bowl to release the dough onto your work surface. Using your fingers, gently press down and deflate the dough. Collect and press all the edges into the middle, flip the dough, and form a round shape, tucking any loose edges underneath.
14. Using a kitchen scale, weigh the dough. Then, divide it into 3 equal pieces with the dough scraper.
15. Form 3 dough balls, cover them with a damp towel and rest them for 15 minutes.
16. After the dough is rested, make a 21 x 26 cm (8 x 10 in.) rectangle using a rolling pin.
17. Fold the dough in thirds. Then, tuck the tip down toward you. Start rolling the dough slowly toward you, gently pulling the dough downward as you roll to create a smooth, taut skin, but donâ€˜t roll too tightly. 
18. Grease the pan and the lid, and place the three rolls inside.
19. Cover the mold with plastic and place in a warm environment for 1 hour or until the dough has risen to 80â€“90% of the height of the mold.
20. When you have 30 minutes of proofing time left, start preheating the oven to 425ÂºF (220ÂºC).
21. To make a flat-topped loaf, let the dough rise to 75â€“80% of the height of the mold. To make a round-topped loaf, let the dough rise to 85â€“90% of the height of the mold. 
22. For the flat-topped loaf, lower the oven temperature to 415ÂºF (210ÂºC) and bake for 25â€“30 minutes. For the round-topped loaf, lower the oven temperature to 385ÂºF (195ÂºC) and bake for 30 minutes. 
23. Enjoy!
