A few days ago, I came across [this video](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxk8No7rSd3qel18hSzw5_uDMHQQzjre78?si=8YwW1NIuLPzQkbTk) of Bill Hader; I'd gladly reference the source, but I honestly can't pinpoint where I found it.

He is talking about writing, but touches on a couple of topics that seem transferable and relevant to design:

- **Fail fast:** a.k.a share early and often. I'd also note that starting with a generative design approach pays off.
- **On (giving and receiving) feedback:** When providing feedback, focus on explaining what isn't working and why. Refrain from suggesting solutions unless folks specifically ask for it. When receiving feedback, synthesize it and reflect on it. And when others provide potential solutions, exercise your judgment instead of accepting them outright.
