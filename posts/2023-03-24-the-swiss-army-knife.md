This week I used the Swiss Army Knife metaphor way too many times. The idea of a useful, compact, multifunctional and versatile tool is very appealing! Imagine a collection of [small, sharp tools](https://brandur.org/small-sharp-tools) at your service.

I like the idea of the Swiss army knife more than the actual thing. Maybe I never had a good one.
