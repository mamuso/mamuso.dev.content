I have been trying to be more intentional about the photos I take, and I always go out with a few topics in mind. I'm not a photographer, but I'm obsessed with decadent beauty, manifested as old buildings, abandoned places and cars, and rusty shop signs. I'm also a sucker for symmetry.

After trying a few times to bring the kids along unsuccessfully, I'm really enjoying [this book](https://aperture.org/books/eyes-open-24-photography-ideas-for-curious-kids/) about prompts for kids. The projects are very affordable, the examples are fantastic, and the layout is beautiful. The kids are already working on a photo-alphabet!

Aperture also publishes ["Seeing things"](https://aperture.org/books/educational/seeing-things-a-kids-guide-to-looking-at-photographs/), which may be, by far, my favorite photography book.
